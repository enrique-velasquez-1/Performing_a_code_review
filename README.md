# PERFORMING CODE REVIEW

## Project Description
In this project, I'll take on the role of a Senior Data Scientist, performing a code review for a Junior Data Scientist in my team. I'll review and make changes to their logic to ingest, clean, and visualize smartphone data to make sure it follows Python best practices, such as adhering to PEP-8 and DRY principles, as well as readability and documentation.

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Review the definition of the prepare_smartphone_data() function to ensure the code is well-documented and is easily "readable". Update the existing code to remedy any issues with documentation or readability.
2. Review and update the prepare_smartphone_data() function to ensure that it adheres to PEP-8 principles.
3. Review code in the visualize_versus_price() function for adherence to DRY principles. Use the column_to_label() function to remove any logic that was previously duplicated.
4. Review the unit test written below to ensure the test matches logic in the prepare_smartphone_data() function, and make changes as needed. Run the cell to validate the test passes when executed.
